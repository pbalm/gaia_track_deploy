Tool for tracking deployment of Gaia Software Products
======================================================

This repository has a small Python web-service that is intended to track
the collection of deployed softwware products at any Gaia Data
Processing Centre.

To use it:
- Meet the requirements: Have Python 2.x installed with the json and
werkzeug packages. I recommend [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)
to the the dirty installation work for you.
- Clone this repo:
`git clone https://github.com/pbalm/gaia_track_deploy`
- Cd into the directory and start the service:
`cd gaia_track_deploy ; python track_deploy.py`

Hope it helps!
